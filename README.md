# SME Finance AI Agent

An AI-driven chatbot built with Flask and LangChain to provide Colombian SMEs with practical financial guidance. It ingests live government-published documents (DIAN, MinCIT, CCB), chunks them, embeds with OpenAI, and retrieves threshold-filtered answers on cash flow, taxes, financing and more.

## Features

- **Live Document Ingestion**  
  Automatically scrapes and parses official pages to keep regulations and tax codes up to date.  
- **Semantic Retrieval**  
  Uses OpenAI embeddings stored in ChromaDB and a CustomThresholdRetriever to surface only highly relevant chunks.  
- **Structured Advisory Protocol**  
  Enforces multi-section responses (intro, recommended steps, risks/points of attention, optional timeline, closing) via a tailored prompt template.  
- **Interactive Web UI**  
  Responsive Flask interface with session memory, quick-reply buttons, dark-mode toggle and typing indicator for a smooth user experience.
